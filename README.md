# Hangman Game

This script implements the classic Hangman game where the user tries to guess a secret word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the script files.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
3. Place the `words.py` and `images.py` files in the same directory as the script file. The `words.py` file should contain a function `choose_word` that returns a random word from a predefined list. The `images.py` file should contain a list `IMAGES` of hangman images representing the stages of the game.
4. Run the script using the following command:
```bash
python script.py
